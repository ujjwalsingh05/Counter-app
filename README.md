# Counter-app 
It is a shopping cart template which keeps track of number of distinct items in the cart. 
You can add items in the cart and can also remove all entities of any item in the cart.
### The application is hosted on a AWS EC2 instance and is currently running on IP address http://13.127.148.238/ 

**PS-** _I made this application as part of my initial training during internship at Demux Academy. It was a great learning experience about cloud hosting and AWS in particular._
